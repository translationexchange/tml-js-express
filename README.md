# Tr8n Express


## Tr8n = *Tr*[anslatio]*n*

Tr8n is a powerful and robust framework for internationalization. The technology enables developers to quickly offer their sites in hundreds of different languages and integrates with TranslationExchange.com, a cloud based translation service. 

At its core Tr8n removes the need to maintain resource files, and instead uses Translation Markup Language (TML). TML provides a specific syntax for how text should be defined, and is used to identify dynamic data within the text.

Tr8n and TML are currently being used by Microsoft, Yammer and MyHeritage.To learn more about Tr8n and TranslationExchange visit out website.
